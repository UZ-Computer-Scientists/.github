<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
-->

We build software that helps end-users achieve goals efficiently.

Our continuous learning helps us continually improve. Our voracious desire for satisfaction means we yearn to satisfy our client's needs and wants. And our relentless spirit drives us to be consistent.

We're a growing team of computer scientists, interface designers, and programmers to data scientists from the University of Zimbabwe. We believe in the power of open source and collaboration to help more people create robust software.

We always seek like-minded individuals from the University of Zimbabwe to join our mission. If you share our passion for learning by doing, and continuous self-development, contribute to our code, join our team, or become a customer.
